Hi. I’m a native Android developer with 7+ years of software development experience. I’m working with modern development stack: Android Jetpack, AndroidX, Coroutines, LiveData, DataBinding, Room, Rx, DI, MVVM, Git, etc. I also have experience in​ using Flutter/Dart to build cross-platform solutions.

Some areas in which I have extensive experience:
- Media processing (photo, video, audio).
- Geolocation.
- Integration of third-party API like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Dropbox, Amazon.
- Firebase services (FCM, Analytics, Crashlytics, AdMob, etc.).
- Machine learning.
- In-App Purchase.
- Converting Web/IOS apps to Android.
- And more…

Please feel free to contact me and I'll help you at any stage, from an idea or small app to a full-scale solution. Thanks!
